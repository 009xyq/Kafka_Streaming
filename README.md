# Survey-Data-Processing-with-Kafka-Streaming
## Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the generation and processing of survey data using Kafka. It includes two scripts: one for producing random survey data and publishing it to a Kafka topic, and another for consuming the data from the Kafka topic and processing it.

## Project Approach:
1.	Create a Kafka topic with 2 partitions and 2 replications.
2.	Modify the ‘brokers’ and ‘topic’ variables in the script to match Kafka cluster configuration.
3.	Create a Kafka producer, send message to the Kafka topic with name, city, and state attributes generated by Faker.
4.	Create a Kafka consumer.
## Pre requirement
```bash
pip install faker
```
